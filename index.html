		<h1>A Close Analysis to “Virtual Students, Digital Classroom”, by Bei He </h1>
		<p>In the article “Virtual Students, Digital Classroom,” Neil Postman asserts that technology is challenging the traditional education system. Postman lists out the advantages of the traditional classroom, and reminds the reader of some disadvantages of the digital classroom. My essay will analyze his use of rhetorical techniques. Through his passionate tone, his word choices, and his use of counterargument, Postman convincingly asserts that digital technology is not the best way for students to learn at school. </p>
