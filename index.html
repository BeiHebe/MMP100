		<h1>A Close Analysis to “Virtual Students, Digital Classroom”, by Bei He </h1>
		<p>In the article “Virtual Students, Digital Classroom,” Neil Postman asserts that technology is challenging the traditional education system. Postman lists out the advantages of the traditional classroom, and reminds the reader of some disadvantages of the digital classroom. My essay will analyze his use of rhetorical techniques. Through his passionate tone, his word choices, and his use of counterargument, Postman convincingly asserts that digital technology is not the best way for students to learn at school. </p>
		<p>Looking at the title, “Virtual Students, Digital Classroom,” which is an implicit opposite pattern: “Real Students, Traditional Classroom.” The hint in the title allows the reader to have a rough idea of what kind of argument Postman will make. If the virtual matches the digital, the real must correspond to the non-digital, which is the traditional classroom. Furthermore, the word “virtual” indicates that something is so nearly real that it can be regarded as real. It conveys a message that our children almost become virtual students under a technological education system. The words in the title lead the reader toward his assertion, which is that schools should rely less on technology, and focus on the traditional system. </p>
		<p>At the beginning of the essay, Postman introduces his first premise: “One of the principal functions of school is to teach children how to behave in groups.” What is implicit here is that the technological education system is not able to do what the traditional one can do. When it comes to traditional learning, what matters are the atmosphere, the interactions among students and teachers, and internal motivation. According to Postman, these are the big advantages to a traditional classroom. On the other hand, the digital classroom, which leads students to individual learning, handles little of those functions. </p>

		<p>In the second paragraph, Postman asserts that “everything from telegraphy and photography in the nineteenth century to the silicon chip in the twentieth has amplified the din of information.” “Amplify” is used as a derogatory term in this case. For example, in the technology field, we usually use an amplifier to boost an analog signal. However, it strengthens the noise at the same time. What can we expect students to learn from the amplified information? Meanwhile, the author may try to say that no matter how advanced technologies are, a real student always needs the guidance of traditional education system, especially in a digital era. That means, too much information makes it difficult for students to process and select the facts that are really important. 
		Since more and more people have access to digital devices and the internet, the risk of being misled by garbage messages greatly increases. Another premise that the author communicates is that “[t]he role of a school is to help students learn how to ignore and discard information so they can achieve a sense of coherence in their lives.” With the use of the phrase “ignore and discard information,” Postman states that real students are not programmed machines built to passively accept what digital devices provide. Instead, they should learn to filter out useless, or even dangerous data. At this point, Postman persuades the reader to believe that studying in a traditional classroom is a better choice for students to achieve this goal over a digital alternative.</p>

		<p>According to the text, another function of a school is to help students “learn that their own needs sometimes are subordinate to the group’s.” The word “group” suggests that a school is like a small society. Students with diverse backgrounds learn to get along with each other. In a digital classroom, however, the computerized learning system does not teach students to compromise with others because digital classrooms may individualize learning as well as limit communication. When visualizing everyone sitting in front of the computer studying on their own, we don’t see an opportunity to interact with classmates or teachers but only computers. We don’t detect any changes in body languages, pitch or tone of voice with the digital devices. Since these things are crucial for human communication, schools must teach students how to decode and understand a massive amount of data in order to help students adapt to real society. </p>

		<p>We realize that a purely digital education system can’t achieve above goals, why 
		are people still so obsessed with technology? It is because technology brings us convenience and transforms the way we live. Postman uses the word “god” to point out how society treats technology. He asserts that technology has now become a form of religious belief. This is an ironic way to describe the digital transformation from the tradition. </p>

		<p>Postman’s argument is a wake-up call to all of us. It alerts our education system that schools should rely less on technology. Also, his word choices make the argument cogent and convince the reader of reconsidering the role of digital technology in the classrooms, as well as in our lives. </p>
